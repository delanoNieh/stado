# Spatio-Temporal Action Detection with Occlusion

> Pytorch implementation of [Spatio-Temporal Action Detection with Occlusion]().
> 
> Take [Actions as Moving Points](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04608) (MOC) as the backbone.

<br/>

## Overview  

&emsp; Present a new action tubelet detection framework, termed as **MovingCenter Detector (MOC-detector)**, by treating an action instance as a trajectory of moving points. MOC-detector is decomposed into three crucial head branches:

- (1) **Center Branch** for instance center detection and action recognition.
- (2) **Movement Branch** for movement estimation at adjacent frames to form moving point trajectories.
- (3) **Box Branch** for spatial extent detection by directly regressing bounding box size at the estimated center point of each frame.
